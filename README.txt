Hi, 
Just to keep track of usage, it would be really cool if you can 
send an email to [drupal AT arnab DOT org] telling me you're using it.

To Install:
Enable the module, and then go to admin/settings/captcha to enable captchas for various actions.

Notes:
- Uses GD to draw stuff, emits in PNG
- Captcha for comments is contingent upon a patch(#14708) for now. 

Captcha Todo:
- clean up image generation code.
- make captcha distortion more spiffy.
