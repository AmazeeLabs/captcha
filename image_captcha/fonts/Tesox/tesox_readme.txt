The Tesox typeface
==================

The Tesox typeface is created by Stefaan Lippens (also known as soxofaan on
drupal.org, http://drupal.org/user/41478).
It is based on hand drawn characters, converted to a TrueType font with the
FontCapture web service (http://www.fontcapture.com).

Background
----------
The Tesox typeface is created specifically for the image CAPTCHA module
for Drupal (http://drupal.org/project/captcha). For a better out-of-the-box
experience it was desired to include one or more typefaces with the CAPTCHA
module package by default. However, this redistribution raised licensing issues.
For example, according the code hosting policy of drupal.org, only GPL licensed
code and resources are allowed in the drupal.org CVS repository. To avoid
licensing and redistribution issues, it was decided to create a dedicated
typeface for the image CAPTCHA module from scratch.

Licencing
---------
As explained above, the Tesox typeface is included in the CAPTCHA module package
for Drupal, which is GPL licensed. Consequently, the Tesox typeface is GPL
licensed.

Note that because of the nature of the GPL, embedding a GPL licensed typeface in
your document or application, causes the resulting document or application to
be covered by the GPL too.
